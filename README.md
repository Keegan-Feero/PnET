# A repository to hold the PnET model
## What is PnET?
PnET is a suite of three nested computer models which provide a modular approach to simulating the carbon, water and nitrogen dynamics of forest ecosystems. Though primarily a temperate forest canopy model, work is currently underway to generalize PnET and produce a simple, alternative model applicable to all terrestrial ecosystem types.



**Check out `setup.md` for detailed instructions on getting PnET running***
